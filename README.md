# config

configuration and documentation for this server

## directories

- doc - documentation in markdown
- conduit, caddy, gitea, matrix_clients, etc - individual services  
some of these these might have a script called `install.sh`. if so, use it.
note that they were made with fedora in mind, so small details (ash over bash,
adduser syntax) may stop scripts working.
